# AWeatherWebApp-
A weather web app made using Node.js, Express and Open Weather Map API.

It returns the temperature of a given City in degrees.

I used this [blog](https://codeburst.io/build-a-weather-website-in-30-minutes-with-node-js-express-openweather-a317f904897b) to create this app, good for beginners.
